# GoTChat
This project is a forum for all topics realted to Game of Thrones.
It does not reflect a chat application where two people chat with each other. The user is able to
create forums and every person signed up to the app will be able to comment in the chat rooms.
The Forums should only be used for Game of Thrones topics and Theories.

Open the GoTchat.xcworkspace file. #Warning: Xcode has to be installed to run the application.
Change build settings to Swift 3.
Run the application in a simulator preferably iPhoneX.

# Technologies

Besides sending messages the user is able to send images. By tapping on the image it will zoom into the screen
